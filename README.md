# 🔍 Model Evaluation and Cross-Validation
The most basic way to evaluate a predictive model involves the following steps:

- 1️⃣ Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.
- 2️⃣ Train the model on the training set.
- 3️⃣ Measure the training error on the training set.
- 4️⃣ Measure the testing error on the test set.

## 🔁 Cross-Validation
Cross-validation extends this approach by repeatedly splitting the dataset into different training and test subsets.

- ✅ This method helps evaluate the robustness and stability of a model.
- ✅ It provides multiple estimates of generalization performance, reducing the dependence on a single train/test split.
